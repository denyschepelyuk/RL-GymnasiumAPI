# 2) Per‚Äêenv overrides
experiments:
  - env: CartPole-v1
    ga_params:
      pop_size: 80          # smaller population for faster convergence
      mutation_rate: 0.05   # more conservative mutation
    # net_arch, seeds, generations, episodes_per_eval all come from default
    generations: 25

  - env: Acrobot-v1
    # Inherits everything from default

  - env: LunarLander-v2
    ga_params:
      pop_size: 150         # need more diversity for this harder task
      crossover_rate: 0.95
      mutation_rate: 0.3
      mutation_sigma: 0.2
    net_arch: [32,32]       # larger network for complexity
    generations: 300        # allow more generations
    # episodes_per_eval stays at 5, seeds at [0,1,2,3,4]

  # You can add new entries here with only the fields you want to tweak.
